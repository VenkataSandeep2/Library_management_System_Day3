# üìö Library Management System (Java CLI Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of my **Java Developer Internship (Task 3)**.  
It is a **menu-driven CLI-based Library Management System** built in Java.  
The system allows adding books, adding users, issuing and returning books while practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** like **Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation**.
